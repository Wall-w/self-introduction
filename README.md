# self-introduction
    My name is *Wu Guilin*. I'm come from *Hu Bei Province*. Now I am majoring in  Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. With the desire of improving my manipulative ability, I want to become a code farmer. Then, I can make some useful things by this way. But without the proper surrounding, I find I learn it inefficiently. So I want to find someone that we can advance together.
